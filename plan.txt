
Research goals
 
- Develop a framework for evaluating error in approximate arithmetic circuits
- Creating a software implementation first
- Developing a hardware version using HLS
- How do you generate random numbers
- How do you calculate statistics
- How do you export statistics from the FPGA back to software
  ? Optimisation
 
- Using the framework
  - Replicating results from other peoples approximate arithmetic Research
  - Getting new results about other peoples airthmetic Research
  - Trying to investigate the statistical behaviour of errors for large nos of cycles

Getting started:
   - Building a software version: to make sure the problem is understood.
   - Replicate what I did for sampling.
   - Get it working with dumb approx functions.
 - Finding simple approximate arithmetic circuits from the literature
   - Quick read of the survey paper
   - Follow refferences to approximate adder ann/or multiple
   - Build a software fuNction that implemenns apporox aoperatoe
 - Work out what FPGA and FPGA tools you'll use
   - Vivado HLS
   - Zedboard
